        <h4>What we accomplished since last report</h4>
        <p>Team Mail Kimp completed issues under four major goals for our final sprint.  The first two were user stories under the original assignment: 1) As a user I can visit your page for creating new events at /events/new; and 2) As an attendee, I can visit the event detail page to RSVP for an event.  To complete the New Events user story, we wrote code to redirect a user to the event detail page if the submitted form was valid.  In order to complete the RSVP system, we needed to create a conditional test to determine whether the email address entered was valid.  We used an if function to determine whether the string entered was an email address then used an indexOf function to ensure that the email contained “@yale.edu”.  We converted everything to lowercase to avoid issues with capitalization.  Errors were enumerated on our event-detail.html file in a ul element with class="form-errors".</p>
        <p>The next goal was to address management’s interest in increasing our click-through rate by changing page elements.  We put the Google Analytics code into each html file.  However, this did not work initially.  We then moved the Google Analytics source code to layout.html.  This propagated across all pages then worked.  However, we realized we hadn’t added a “Donate” link which limited the amount of data we had.  However, we still collected enough to conduct an experiment.</p>
        <h4>(1)	How your traffic breaks down across different segments and how they flow through your "funnel" from landing to donation.</h4>
        <p>On February 17, 2015, 82.2% of traffic to our page was referred from yale.edu, about 11% from som.yale.edu, 3.2% from divinity.yale.edu, 2% from law.yale.edu, and 2% from other sources.  </p>
        <p>All users from the yale.edu domain are starting at the landing page.  Of those, 565 (95%) drop off and 31 (5%) continue to another page.  Of those who click through, roughly 55% will go event-0, 27% to event-2, 14% to event-1, and 4% create a new event.  We did not receive data for users from the other domains.</p>
        <h4>(2) if making the event links on the home page include the word "RSVP" would increase click-through rate</h4>
        <p>        </p>
        <h4>(3) if they should ask people to "donate" or "support" an event in the donation link text to increase conversions.</h4>
        <p></p>
        <p>The last major goal was enhancing the visual presentation through CSS.  For the CSS changes, we enhanced colors, fonts.  We developed custom headers and footers.  We used color dropper to find the hex codes for our custom header.  The images were updated on each page.  Finally we optimized sizing for greatest visibility.</p>
        <p>After making all of these changes, we discovered a number of bugs in our code which added a number of story points. The team had developed a good process for digging into the mocha tests to understand what exactly the problem was and was able to fix all the bugs quickly.</p>
